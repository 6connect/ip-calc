# IPv6 Subnet Calculator

This is a tool to calculate IPv6 subnets. It's similar to [sipcalc](https://github.com/sii/sipcalc), but runs entirely inside the browser and has a graphical user interface.

# Development

This is based off of [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Start a development server at `http://localhost:3000/` and watch for changes:
```shell
npm run start
```

Create a production build in `/build/`:
```shell
npm run build
```
